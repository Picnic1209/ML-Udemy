1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,330
Hey there.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,500
This is Future Daniel.

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,690
Why future Daniel.

4
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,520
Well because I've just finished off recording the last video for this entire section.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,830
The psychic land section so you might see in an upcoming video I save to a list.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,030
What we're covering.

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,640
Section by section an end to and workflow.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,040
Getting the data ready.

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,120
Choosing the right estimated slash machine learning algorithm for our problems Fitting the model algorithm

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,670
to the data and using it to make predictions and a few more steps and what you'll probably quickly realize

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,770
is that this a pretty big section.

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:38,370
So if I scroll through the entire notebook all the code that we're gonna cover there is a lot here.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:38,890
Right.

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,620
Right through.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,330
Keep following through this is don't worry.

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:48,600
This is across the next 25 30 or so videos that you're gonna go through and here's that list that I

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,800
created right at the start right.

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,490
I think this is an in an upcoming video and now seeing this to start out with can be pretty intimidating.

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:02,040
That's what I want to sort of warn you right is that because there is so much because we are going through

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,680
a lot of different concepts of not only machine learning but psychic learn as itself.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,540
I wanted to make an auxiliary resource that you can kind of come to and get a quick overview of what

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,370
we're doing.

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,820
So this list although it tells you what's happening it doesn't really tell you much other than just

24
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,060
the headings of the different sections.

25
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,240
So that's why there's resource that'll be available in the resources section there'll be some sort of

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,100
link in a place that you can find it.

27
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,210
So don't worry.

28
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,690
This is what we're covering in the cyclone introduction.

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,790
So this is kind of like a table of contents for this massive notebook that we're going to go through.

30
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,490
And don't worry even ones going through the entire cyclone section you're probably not going to know

31
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,380
all this off by heart.

32
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,930
And if it seems like I know all this off by heart and I were going through it I'm seeming like wow I

33
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,060
could never do that.

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,460
Don't be mistaken.

35
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,190
I've had a fair bit of practice with the cyclone library and that's why I'm able to go through and sort

36
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,110
of figure out things and know where to look and go to the documentation and go I can see this function

37
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,270
to do that this function to do that.

38
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,660
So going through it for the first time remind yourself learning something new takes time and learning

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,750
anything worthwhile definitely takes time especially machine learning.

40
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,180
And so this is the framework that we're going to be using for the introduction we saw this in the previous

41
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,550
video that Kino we went through step one we're going to get the data ready we're gonna find out how

42
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,690
to pick a cyclone model we're going to fit model system data so we can make a prediction we're gonna

43
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,570
evaluate our model see if it's worthwhile even using the model that we've got you'll see there's a couple

44
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,130
of different ways to use this depending on the model we're using will improve through experimentation

45
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:47,220
because after all machine learning is all about experimentation and the quicker you can reduce your

46
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,570
time between experiments the more you're going to get done the more insights you're going to figure

47
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,580
out about your data about your machine learning models and they're going to look at saving and reloading

48
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,100
trained machine learning models so you don't have to go through all these steps again you can save a

49
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,860
model send it to a friend send it to a colleague put it in your application and use it.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,220
That was a bit of a mouthful in itself but if you go through this resource you'll see that I've got

51
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:19,190
at the top standard library imports treat this as like the mini version of this.

52
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,410
So this is the big behemoth that we're about to go through in this section through all 30 or so videos

53
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,790
but this is like the mini overview you can quickly refer to.

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,150
So you're not scrolling back and forth through all the stuff that's going in here.

55
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,470
So to begin with we've got some standard library imports we're going to see how we can import data sets

56
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,160
to use examples in the psychic line we're going to focus on a classification and a regression problem

57
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,600
using our heart disease and Boston data sets.

58
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,330
Step one is getting the data ready.

59
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,680
Right.

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,170
So each of these sections refers to a little step in this workflow get the data ready you'll see the

61
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,930
functions that we use there you'll see Section two is how we pick a model to how we choose a machine

62
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,770
learning model for what problem we're working on this is one of the toughest things that you'll see

63
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,260
in machine learning problems but again once we get familiar with this diagram the psychic machine learning

64
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:16,050
map you'll start to see ah it's actually not as hard as you once might have thought and then again there's

65
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,640
some code that you might use for choosing a model in instantiating one.

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,930
Then there's some code here you'll see the functions that we use to fit a model to training data to

67
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,190
make predictions.

68
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,680
We can view our predictions slash predicted probabilities predict the probabilities is done with predict

69
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,370
probe.

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,550
And if we come back down here we'll see how we can evaluate our model.

71
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,640
And there's a link here there's a you'll see in the documentation there's a few different ways to evaluate

72
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,470
different socket loan models.

73
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,360
This is a great section I highly suggest reading through here because it's one thing to train a machine

74
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,970
learning model.

75
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,630
It's another thing to check if it's doing the right thing what you want it to do.

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,580
Once we've gone through evaluating a model we'll see how we can improve our models through experimentation.

77
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,740
What we're going to focus on is hyper parameter tuning a.k.a. turning the settings and our model and

78
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,680
improving it.

79
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,460
Just like if we wanted to adjust our oven and while oven was cooking our favorite meal maybe it doesn't

80
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,080
do so well on 180 degrees but it does really well on 200 degrees.

81
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,800
The same thing goes with machine learning models out of the box.

82
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,510
It might work pretty well but if you adjust the settings are slightly you might get a better model.

83
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,210
So we'll see that in Section 5.

84
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,560
Then in section six we'll see how to save and reload our trained models so we can avoid going through

85
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,680
all the previous steps before if we wanted to save and share our model.

86
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,340
And then in Step 7 which is kind of a bonus which is not pictured in the workflow is we're gonna put

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,790
all of the above steps together in a single cell so that looks like a lot of code at the moment but

88
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,630
don't worry we're gonna step through it by the time you're at the end of this section.

89
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,130
None of this will be unfamiliar.

90
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,130
So with that being said Get yourself ready and get yourself excited pour yourself a cup of coffee or

91
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,300
go take a little walk or something get yourself in the mindset to learn machine learning because that's

92
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,260
what we're going to do we're going to get into the psychic loan library and all of its magical goodness.

93
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,790
So I'll see you in the next video.
